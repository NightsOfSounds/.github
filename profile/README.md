## Who are we?

We are Nights Of Sounds, two guys running a music related YouTube channel. 
As we also are software-developers, we write some code to help us with our work.

## Why does this repository exist?

We want to share our projects (like the source code for our website) with you, so that we can all learn from each other ^^

## How to get in contact

If you want to get in contact with us, there are two main ways of doing so. 
Sending an email or creating an issue, so feel free to use one of these ways if you need something from us, or want to send us a message.
